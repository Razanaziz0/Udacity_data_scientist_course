## About Project
#### This is the project of Udacity's data scientist nanodegree program ,I'm going to apply the CRISP-DM process to analyze on Airbnb Seattle.

#### The analysis started with three questions as follows.

1-When do reservations increase in Seattle?what is the busiest season ?

2-If bookings increase is prices increase also ?

3-is the property prices change based on neighborhoods and high review scores ?

In order to answer the questions, I will follow the CRISP-DM process
